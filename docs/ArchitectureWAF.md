## WAF Pillars Implementation

### üîê Security
- **Zero Trust Network:** Private VNet with private endpoints for all PaaS services
- **Identity & Access:** Managed identities with RBAC and least-privilege access
- **Secure Admin Access:** Azure Bastion + Jumpbox for internal administration
- **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault integration

### üìä Operational Excellence  
- **Observability:** Centralized logging via Log Analytics Workspace
- **Application Monitoring:** Application Insights for telemetry and diagnostics
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Bicep templates with parameterized configurations

### üöÄ Performance Efficiency
- **Auto-scaling:** Container Apps with configurable scaling policies
- **Regional Proximity:** Resources deployed in optimal Azure regions

### üí∞ Cost Optimization
- **Right-sizing:** Parameterized SKUs and capacity settings
- **Resource Sharing:** Shared networking and monitoring infrastructure

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability
- **High Availability:** Multi-zone deployment options
- **Data Redundancy:** Configurable geo-replication for critical data stores
- **Private Connectivity:** Eliminates internet dependencies

## Core Architecture Components
